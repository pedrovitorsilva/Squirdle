# Squirdle
Website that performs filtering and helps play the game Squirdle

Squirdle (https://squirdle.fireblend.com/) is a game based on the game Wordle. 
In this game, based on data about Pokémon (generation, height, weight, types), the objective is to discover which Pokémon it is.

The website receives this data by simple user inputs, and returns to the user a list of possibilities based on the parameters provided.

* Squirdle 2.0 - The JS Update *

The code has been completely ported to the Node.js environment, providing users with a much simpler and visual experience compared to the terminal, all on the web.

The new version features images of *all* Pokémon, a search bar with autocomplete, and customizable color layouts based on the selected Pokémon's color palette.

It accepts inputs from both the mouse and arrow keys.

The page layout is inspired by the layout of the Pokémon Emerald game.
